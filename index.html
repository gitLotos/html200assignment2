          Responsive Web Design (RWD) is critical in today's technology where users
          are able to view the internet through a variety devices such as
          mobile phones, desktop computers, gaming consoles, accessibility devices
          and legacy machines.  As the demographic of the internet user bases changes
          in the next decade the web will need to be developed in such a manner
          that will be capable of not only growing with technology but following
          trends in which these demographics choose to access the internet.

          In merely the past 20 years computers have gone through an evolution of
          viewing the web on large 4:3 CRT screens to 16:9 hand held mobile devices
          of varying screen sizes. To meet this ever growing need for internet
          access RWD technologies have been invented to allow developers to
          implement common design patterns that are able to address these complex problems.

          It will be interesting to see what the internet will look like and the
          development methods necessary in the next 20 years.
